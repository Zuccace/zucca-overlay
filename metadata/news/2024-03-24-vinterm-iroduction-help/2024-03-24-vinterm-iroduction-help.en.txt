I've introduced a new package called vinterm.
It's like cool-retro-term, but with way fewer dependencies.
However, it seems that it doesn't play well with Xwayland.

The ebuild isn't complete, but you can still test the vinterm.

If you get it working with Xwayland, then please Open up a thread
in "unsupported software" subforum at forums.gentoo.org and
hit me (Zucca)with a PM.

Thank you.
