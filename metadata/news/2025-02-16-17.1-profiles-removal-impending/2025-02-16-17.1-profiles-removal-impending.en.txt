If you happen to be one of those who use
my custom 17.1 profiles, be aware that those
are now deprecated and will be removed soon
after new profiles (openrc-init and seatd)
are introduced.

Currently all the profile related things are a mess.
But after a major refactoring things will start to
move and disappear.

If you don't use my profiles, there's nothing
you need to act upon.

So we'll see again after new profiles are ready. Bye!
