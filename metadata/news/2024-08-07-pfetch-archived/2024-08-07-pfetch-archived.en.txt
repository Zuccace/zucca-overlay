pfetch development has stopped and it's being removed from ::guru.
I (Zucca) have created several ebuilds for different versions of pfetch.

dylanaraps has archived all his repos on github:
"This repository has been archived by the owner
on Apr 26, 2024. It is now read-only."

And on his profile reads the following:
"Have taken up farming."

We wish all the best in the future for dylanaraps.
He may, in fact, have escaped the Marix.
Until then, we'll continue taking the wrong pills and keep using pfetch.
