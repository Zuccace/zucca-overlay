= Yet another gentoo repo/overlay.

Development happens at https://codeberg.org/Zucca/gentoo-overlay[Codeberg].

Github repository will get updates rarely and randomly.
I'll try to remember to push changes to github, when I feel everything's fixed and seem to be stable.
So if you sync via github don't expect frequent updates.
